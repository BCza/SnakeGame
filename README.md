# SnakeGame

This is a repo designed to see what you can do with just vanilla js.  Initially I did a silly internet tutorial to make a snake game and I've used it ever since as a playground to see what I can do with JS and JS alone.

I've often heard that if you don't use a framework you have to invent a framework. We'll see. 

I can see already that having react would make the UI a much easier operation.
